Feedback from our partners is of paramount importance to us, since we can\nget an accurate understanding of the areas where we made progress since the last survey, or where there\nis still room for improvement - and we can further enhance the quality of our services by embracing your\nideas and suggestions.\nWe provided feedback to the remarks made by our partners after the survey of 2021 in a new format. We\nstrived to deliver a customised, written answer to every single opinion and suggestion, and we also had\nbilateral discussions with our partners who gave more complex feedback. All this with the aim of\nexpressing how much we appreciate and consider all remarks, and how useful we find them. Because of\nthe positive experiences, we plan to keep this format for this year's survey as well.\nThe time has come to ask you again in our new survey. Please share your experiences, ideas with us so we\ncan further improve our services for your convenience and satisfaction.\nThank you for your cooperation in advance.\nSincerely yours,\nSzabolcs I.
